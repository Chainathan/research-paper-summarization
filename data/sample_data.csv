hydrogen in spectrum and plateau in optical light curve ) , ii - linear ( ii - l ; hydrogen in spectrum , no plateau in optical light curve ) , iin ( hydrogen in spectrum and spectral and photometric evidence for interaction between sn ejecta and a dense circumstellar medium [ csm ] ) , iib ( hydrogen in spectrum initially , but transforms into a hydrogen - deficient spectrum at later times ) , and ib / c ( no evidence for hydrogen in spectrum at any time ) , where the ordering is a roughly increasing one in terms of inferred degree of envelope stripping prior to explosion ( i.e. , ii - p are the least stripped at the time of explosion , and ib / c are the most stripped ) . the hertzsprung - russell diagram ( hrd ) of the stars evolutionary tracks are shown in figure  1 for stars ranging in initial mass from @xmath1 . comparison with other contemporary model grids ( e.g. , @xcite ; @xcite ) show that the endpoints for stars in the @xmath2 range differ by at most @xmath3 dex in luminosity among the codes @xcite , which gives some assurance that systematic uncertainties are not great , at least at the low - mass end for red supergiant ( rsg ) stars . two areas of uncertainty in need of better quantification ( or , at least , agreement within the community ) include the effects that stellar rotation and mass - loss might have on the observable characteristics of stars prior to core collapse . not surprisingly , when no progenitor star is actually detected at the sn location in pre - sn images , only an upper limit to the progenitor s luminosity and , hence , mass , can be derived . to illustrate the analysis process in such a situation , i consider sn  2006my , an sn we then compared this with the final luminosity of stars with @xmath16 predicted by the stars stellar evolution models ( figure 2c ) to derive an upper bound on the progenitor mass of @xmath17 . from this analysis , then , we conclude that any rsg progenitor with an initial mass greater than @xmath18 would have been detected using our analysis procedure .    analyses similar to that described here for sn  2006my have been carried out on each of 22 non - detections in pre - sn images @xcite . as we shall see (   4 ) , it is the sheer number of such progenitor non - detections that permits rather strong conclusions to be drawn about cc sn progenitors from this category of progenitor studies . * ) and sn  2005gl @xcite . initially , strong claims for the unexpectedly luminous progenitor / sn  2005gl association had to be tempered by consideration of the distance of sn  2005gl s host galaxy . at over 60 mpc away , the @xmath28 resolution of the pre - sn _ hst _ image corresponds to @xmath5 pc , which raises suspicion that the object could be , e.g. , an unresolved stellar cluster or association of several massive stars , with only part of the light coming from the actual progenitor of sn  2005gl @xcite . * and references therein ) , and would have easily been detected in the pre - sn images . * type ii - linear : * a rare type of cc sn , it is perhaps not surprising that only one sn  ii - l ( sn  1980k ) has a pre - sn image , the analysis of which rules out massive rsg greater than about @xmath33 @xcite . * type iib : * pre - sn images exist for two events . * and references therein ) . the science of seeking sn progenitors has made tremendous strides in just the last ten years . for the future , clearly , we are just at the beginning stages of this exciting field of research , and great advances will no doubt be made in the coming decade . i thank the scientific organizing committee of the `` hot and cool : bridging gaps in massive star evolution '' conference for inviting me to provide this review . i thank seppo mattila for permitting reproduction of a figure from a recent paper , and stephen smartt for allowing the use of figures in advance of publication of his annual reviews article on the topic .
